	In 2017, agriculture accounted for 9% of global Greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Feeding 7 billion people is indeed one of the most important tasks of human kind, and those practices have been around for millennia, but have, without a doubt, changed quite a bit. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization provides a rich and open dataset called FAOSTAT, containing statistics on agricultural production and emissions, fertilizer use, trade,  prices, food security and annual population by country from 1961 up until today.
